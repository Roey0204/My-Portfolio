# My Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Roey! I have a background from Electronic in Bachelor Degree and now on track to completing my Master in computer science. 

During my studies, I figure out that I have very great passion on writing code.End of the year, I decide to move forward for the final year project in FPGA. 
The objective on researching FPGA is to develop my understand on:

i) Digital Logic Design: Understanding how to design digital circuits using Verilog or VHDL, including combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, and other digital components.

ii) FPGA Architecture and Tools: Familiarizing myself with the architecture of the FPGA i am using, as well as the development tools provided by the FPGA vendor (e.g.Intel Quartus Prime). This includes understanding synthesis, place and route, and timing analysis.

iii) Hardware Description Languages (HDLs): Learning Verilog or VHDL to describe the behavior and structure of digital circuits. This involves understanding the syntax, semantics, and best practices for writing HDL code.

iv) Embedded Systems: Integrating soft or hard processors into FPGA designs, designing interfaces with peripherals, and understanding how to program and debug embedded systems on FPGAs.

For more details on the final year project can refer to the PDF below.

After graduated, I join MNC company as UI-UX Engineer(2 years) and Test Software Engineer(2 Years).

Throughout the years, I have developed a strong foundation through participate some project to build fundamental on object-oriented programming, microcontroller programming, data acquisition, data modeling, Internet of things, machine learning etc.

In my free time, I enjoy to exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in software/data relevant whether from working at daily job or independently
